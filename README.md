# ChemistryFeaturization.jl
Unified graph building and featurizing for Weave.jl, CrystalGraphConvNets.jl, and (maybe soon) more!

## Future Plans:
### v0.1
* graph-building and featurizing for CrystalGraphConvNets.jl
* featurizing for Weave.jl
* featurization and inversion
* some basic documentation/examples

### later...
* saving out featurization metadata (features used, bins, etc.) in consistent format
* consistent handling of numerical vs. categorical features
* "hybrid" featurizations using features from multiple paradigms if available
* more input file formats?
